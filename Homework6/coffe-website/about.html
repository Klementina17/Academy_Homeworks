                <h2>History of Coffee</h2>

                <p>
                    Coffee has a long and fascinating history that stretches back centuries. According to legend,
                    coffee was first discovered in the highlands of <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, where a goat herder
                    noticed his goats becoming unusually energetic after eating the red berries from a certain plant.
                    Those berries were coffee cherries — and humans soon learned how to roast and brew the seeds inside.

                    In the 15th and 16th centuries, coffee spread from Ethiopia to the <strong>Arab world</strong>,
                    especially
                    Yemen, where the first simple coffeehouses opened. These early coffeehouses became social hubs for
                    conversation, music, and poetry. Coffee drinking and the skill of roasting and brewing quickly
                    became an important part of daily life in the Middle East.

                    By the 17th century, coffee reached <strong>Europe</strong>. Coffeehouses appeared in cities like
                    Venice, London, and Paris and became popular meeting places for artists, merchants, and thinkers.
                    Because coffee encouraged alert conversation and socializing, some called coffeehouses
                    the “schools of the wise.”

                    As global trade and colonial expansion grew, coffee plants were transported to Asia and the
                    Americas.
                    In the 18th and 19th centuries large coffee plantations were established in places like
                    <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Colombia</strong>, and <strong>Vietnam</strong>, and these
                    countries
                    later became major producers of the world’s coffee supply.

                    Today, coffee is one of the most consumed beverages on earth. It has evolved into countless regional
                    styles and modern specialty drinks, while remaining an important cultural and economic product
                    for millions of people around the world.

                <h2>Brewing Methods</h2>

                <p>Coffee can be made in many different ways, and each method brings out a unique flavor.</p>

                    <li><strong>French Press:</strong> Steeps ground coffee in hot water for a rich and full taste.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pour Over:</strong> Hot water is poured slowly over coffee grounds for a clean, smooth
                        flavor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moka Pot:</strong> A stovetop method that makes coffee similar to espresso.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold Brew:</strong> Coffee is brewed in cold water for 12–24 hours — smooth, less
                        acidic.

                <h2>Coffee Around the World</h2>

                <p>
                    Coffee travels the world in many forms, and each country has its own special way of turning simple
                    beans into something unforgettable. In Italy, the day begins with a quick shot of espresso taken
                    while standing at the bar — short, strong, and full of tradition. Meanwhile, Turkey has a
                    completely different ritual: coffee is boiled slowly in a small pot called a
                    <em>cezve</em>, resulting in a thick, intense drink that is often used to tell fortunes from the
                    remaining grounds.
                    If you visit Greece during the summer, you will almost certainly see people sipping icy frappes
                    and Freddo espressos — cool, refreshing drinks perfect for the warm Mediterranean climate. Far
                    away in Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee, the drink is part of a special ceremony where beans
                    are roasted, ground, and brewed in front of guests — a beautiful reminder that coffee is more than
                    a beverage; it is a moment shared.
                    Across the ocean, Brazil grows some of the world’s most popular coffee beans, often known for
                    their sweet and nutty flavor. And in Japan, coffee culture has taken a modern twist with precise
                    pour-over brewing and even canned coffee sold in vending machines. No matter where you go, each
                    country adds its own personality to the cup — proving that coffee is a global language everyone
                    understands.

                <h2>Coffee Beans: Arabica vs. Robusta</h2>
                <p>
                    Coffee beans mainly come in two types: <strong>Arabica</strong> and <strong>Robusta</strong>, and
                    each offers a very different flavor. Arabica beans are smooth, sweet, and often have hints of fruit
                    or chocolate. They are considered higher quality, but the plants are delicate and harder to grow,
                    which makes Arabica more expensive. Robusta beans, in contrast, are much stronger and more bitter,
                    with almost double the caffeine. They grow easily in harsh climates and are often used in instant
                    coffee and espresso blends for extra strength. In simple terms, Arabica gives a gentle, complex
                    taste, while Robusta delivers a bold, powerful kick — and many coffees mix the two to get the best
                    balance of flavor and energy.
